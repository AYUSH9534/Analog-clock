# Analog-clock
Analog Clock Project Description:

The analog clock project is a web-based application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It aims to create a digital representation of a traditional analog clock on a web page. 

HTML: 
The HTML file sets up the basic structure of the web page. It consists of a `<div>` element that acts as the container for the clock. Inside this div, there are three nested `<div>` elements representing the hour hand, minute hand, and second hand of the clock.

CSS:
The CSS file defines the styling of the clock elements. It includes properties to position the clock hands at the center of the container div and style them to resemble traditional clock hands. Additionally, it sets up the clock face by using a circular div with appropriate dimensions and border radius.

JavaScript:
The JavaScript code is responsible for making the clock functional. It utilizes the `setInterval()` function to update the clock hands' positions continuously based on the current time.

The code uses JavaScript's `Date` object to retrieve the current time, including hours, minutes, and seconds. It calculates the corresponding degrees for each hand based on the time and updates the CSS `transform` property of each hand element to rotate them accordingly.

By refreshing the clock hands' positions at regular intervals, the JavaScript code ensures that the clock appears to be in continuous motion, accurately reflecting the current time.
